# 5. Analyzing results

...


## 5.1 Method #1: Neural networks (using a multilayer perceptron in Weka)

```bash
$ bundle exec ruby analyze.rb ../4-calculating-probabilities/results/mlp.csv
```

## 5.2 Method #2: K-nearest neighbours (again using Weka)

```bash
$ bundle exec ruby analyze.rb ../4-calculating-probabilities/results/knn.csv
```

## 5.3 Method #3: Multiple linear regression (using R)

```bash
$ bundle exec ruby analyze.rb ../4-calculating-probabilities/results/mlr.csv
```
